### **Analysis of the Classic BCPL Stack Frame and ABI Compatibility**

This document outlines the characteristics of the traditional BCPL stack frame and justifies the decision for this new compiler to adhere to the modern C Application Binary Interface (ABI) for targets like Linux and macOS.

### **1\. The Classic BCPL Stack Frame: A Minimalist Design**

The stack frame used by early BCPL compilers was a model of efficiency and simplicity, designed for the resource-constrained systems of the 1960s and 70s. Its structure was fundamentally different from the stack frames used by modern C-like languages.
A typical function call would create a frame on the stack containing only the essentials:

1. **Arguments:** The caller would push the function's arguments onto the stack.
2. **Return Address:** The call instruction would push the address of the instruction to return to after the function finished.
3. **Local Variables:** Space for the function's local variables was allocated on the stack.

#### **The Key Difference: No Dynamic Link Chain**

The most significant distinction is what was **missing**: a saved frame pointer from the calling function.

* **C ABI Stack:** In the standard C ABI (used by Linux, macOS, and others), every function's stack frame begins by saving the caller's frame pointer and then setting the new frame pointer to the current stack position. This creates a **dynamic link chain**â€”a linked list of frame pointers on the stack that perfectly traces the call history.
* **BCPL Stack:** The classic BCPL stack had no such chain. The stack was a contiguous block of data for arguments, return addresses, and locals, but there was no standardized pointer linking one function's frame to the previous one. This is often referred to as a **"spaghetti stack"** because, from an outside perspective (like a debugger), the call history is an tangled mess that is difficult to unwind.

### **2\. Why We Don't (and Can't) Support the Classic BCPL Stack**

While the classic stack was elegant and had unique advantages (such as making coroutines easier to implement), it is fundamentally incompatible with modern operating systems for several critical reasons. Adhering to the platform's C ABI is not just a choice for convenience; it is a requirement for interoperability.

#### **Reason 1: ABI Incompatibility**

This is the most important reason. An **Application Binary Interface (ABI)** is a strict contract that governs how compiled code interacts. It defines:

* How function arguments are passed (in registers or on the stack).
* How return values are handled.
* Which registers are preserved across calls.
* **Crucially, how the stack is managed.**

All compiled code on an operating system, from the lowest-level C library (libc) functions like printf and malloc to the highest-level application code, must obey this contract.
If our BCPL compiler generated code using the classic, unlinked stack frame, it would be impossible for our BCPL programs to call any standard library or operating system function. A call to printf would fail because our code would not have set up the stack and registers in the way printf expects. The program would crash immediately.

#### **Reason 2: Toolchain and Debugger Reliance**

The entire modern software development ecosystem is built on the assumption that programs adhere to the standard ABI.

* **Debuggers (GDB, LLDB):** When you type bt (backtrace) in a debugger, it works by walking the dynamic link chain of frame pointers on the stack. Without this chain, the debugger would be completely blind, unable to provide any meaningful call stack information.
* **Profilers:** Tools like perf on Linux sample the program's state to find performance bottlenecks. They rely on being able to unwind the stack to attribute time spent to specific call chains. This would not work.
* **Exception Handling:** Mechanisms for handling hardware exceptions and software errors (like C++ exceptions) depend on a standardized, unwindable stack to correctly propagate errors and clean up resources.

#### **Reason 3: Modern Security Features**

Operating systems implement critical security protections that are deeply integrated with the standard stack layout.

* **Stack Canaries:** Compilers insert a random value (a "canary") on the stack before a function's local variables. Before the function returns, it checks if this value has been overwritten. This detects and prevents common buffer overflow attacks. This mechanism requires a predictable stack frame layout.
* **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):** While not strictly dependent on the stack frame, ASLR is part of a suite of security tools that assume a standard process memory layout. Deviating from the norm can have unforeseen security consequences.

### **Conclusion**

The decision to make our BCPL compiler follow the platform-specific C ABI is a pragmatic and necessary one. While the classic BCPL stack is an interesting historical artifact with a clever design, using it would isolate our compiled programs from the rest of the operating system, rendering them unable to call system libraries and incompatible with all modern debugging, profiling, and security tools.
By adopting the C ABI, we ensure that our compiled BCPL code is a "first-class citizen" on Linux and macOS, able to interoperate seamlessly with C libraries and benefit from the rich ecosystem of modern development tools.
